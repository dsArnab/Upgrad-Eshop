# Upgrad-Eshop

I have prepared the front-end of the application. Setting (isAdmin === false) in the App.js component will make sure that the page look is changed for a normal user. However, when I am signing in from an admin account, I am not able to open an admin UI. To show the functionalities I have added, I have represented the admin view in the begining.
